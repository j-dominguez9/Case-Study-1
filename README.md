# Case-Study-1
Midterm Project DDS
Author: Joaquin Dominguez

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between multiple variables within the beers.csv and breweries.csv data sets and report insightful findings.

### Conclusion
We found that alcohol by volume (ABV) and the international bitterness units (IBU) are important to consider in the context of beers. They also appear to be significant metrics by which to distinguish styles of beer, such as IPAs and Ales. It is important to note that more data is needed to explore the causal relationship of ABV and IBU. We highlight the potential importance of ABV and IBU and provide insights with regard to what it could provide.

Additionally, we created machine learning models (knn and Naive-Bayes) to predict preferences of Style by Geography (City or State). We visualized that data through a tableau workbook (listed under Presentation folder). These models have potential to be used for R&D and marketing strategies.
